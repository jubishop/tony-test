[![Rubocop Status](https://github.com/jubishop/tony-test/workflows/Rubocop/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jubishop/tony-test/actions/workflows/rubocop.yml)

Helpers for testing [Tony](https://github.com/jubishop/tony).

## Installation

### In a Gemfile

```ruby
source: 'https://www.jubigems.org/' do
  gem 'tony-test'
end
```

## RSpec

`tony-test` is designed for use with [`RSpec`](https://rspec.info) on top of either [`rack-test`](https://github.com/rack/rack-test) for basic http testing, or [`capybara-apparition`](https://github.com/twalpole/apparition) for testing inside a Chrome browser, with Javascript support and the ability to capture screenshots.

### Rack-Test

In your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require `tony-test`

RSpec.shared_context(:rack_test) {
  include_context(:tony_rack_test)

  let(:app) {
    # Create your tony app here.  Tony::App.new or whatever.
  }
  let(:cookie_secret) {
    # Return the same cookie secret string the app will be using.
  }
}
```

Now in any individual `_spec.rb` test file:

```ruby
# `type: :rack_test` will pull in the helpers for rack-test.
RSpec.describe(MyTonyApp, type: :rack_test) {
  it('does something') {
    # You can set cookies
    set_cookie(:key, 'value')

    # Standard stuff you do in rack-test
    get '/'

    # All standard Capybara matchers are available
    expect(last_response.body).to(have_selector('p.class'))
    expect(last_response.ok?).to(be(true))

    # You have two new matchers for content generated by `AssetTagHelper`:
    # have_fontawesome, and have_googlefonts
    expect(last_response.body).to(have_googlefonts)
  }
}
```

### Apparition

In your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require `tony-test`

# Of course you need to set Capybara.app here and call Capybara.register_driver
# and anything else to set up Capybara as per its documentation.

RSpec.shared_context(:apparition) do
  include_context(:tony_apparition)

  let(:cookie_secret) {
    # Return the same cookie secret string the app will be using.
  }
end
```

Now in any individual `_spec.rb` test file:

```ruby

# `type: :apparition` will pull in the helpers for apparition.
RSpec.describe(MyTonyApp, type: :apparition) {
  it('does something') {
    # You can set cookies
    set_cookie(:key, 'value')

    # Standard stuff you do in apparition
    visit('/')

    # All standard Capybara matchers are available
    expect(page).to(have_selector('p.class'))

    # You have two new matchers for content generated by `AssetTagHelper`:
    # have_fontawesome, and have_googlefonts
    expect(page).to(have_googlefonts)
  }
}
```
